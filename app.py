        This app predicts whether a telecom customer will **churn** (stop using the service)
        based on their demographic and service usage data.

        **Instructions:**
        - Use the sidebar to input customer features such as tenure, service subscriptions,
          payment method, and monthly charges.
        - Select a machine learning model for prediction:
          - **Logistic Regression:** Simple, interpretable, baseline model.
          - **XGBoost:** Advanced model that often yields higher accuracy.
        - Click **Predict** to see:
          - The probability the customer will churn.
          - The predicted churn status.
          - An explanation plot showing which features influenced the prediction using SHAP values.

        This tool can help telecom providers identify customers at risk of leaving and tailor retention strategies accordingly.
